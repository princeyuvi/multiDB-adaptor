<pre>This project does 2 things:
    1. Converts the database query of specified one to another specified database.
       This helps in migrating the database from existing to new.
    2. Finds if the query belongs to Apache hive, Postgres or MongoDB
       This helps in detecting the correct database to run the query if an application has multiple databases.
       
Both the tasks are done using chatGPT language model.
